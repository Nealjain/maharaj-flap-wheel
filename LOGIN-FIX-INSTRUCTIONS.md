# Login Redirect Loop Fix

## What Was Fixed

The login page was redirecting back to itself due to:
1. Race condition between auth state updates
2. Premature loading state completion
3. Missing proper event handling in auth state changes

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Auth Provider (`lib/auth.tsx`)
- Added proper cleanup with `mounted` flag
- Better event handling for SIGNED_IN, SIGNED_OUT, TOKEN_REFRESHED
- More detailed console logging for debugging

### 2. Improved Login Page (`app/login/page.tsx`)
- Better error handling
- Removed premature redirect
- Let useEffect handle redirect after auth state updates
- Added console logs for debugging

## How to Test

### Step 1: Clear Browser Storage
Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### Step 2: Check Console Logs
When you try to login, you should see:
```
Attempting login for: admin@maharaj.com
Initial session: Found/None
Auth state changed: SIGNED_IN admin@maharaj.com
User signed in successfully
User authenticated, redirecting to dashboard...
```

### Step 3: Try Login
1. Go to `/login`
2. Enter credentials:
   - Email: `admin@maharaj.com`
   - Password: `Admin@123`
3. Click "Sign in"
4. Should redirect to `/dashboard`

## If Still Not Working

### Option 1: Use Debug Page
1. Go to `/login-debug`
2. Enter credentials
3. Click "Test Login"
4. Check the detailed error message

### Option 2: Check Browser Console
Look for these errors:
- "Session error" - Database connection issue
- "Login error" - Wrong credentials
- "Failed to get session" - Supabase configuration issue

### Option 3: Verify User Exists
Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  u.email_confirmed_at,
  p.role
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN user_profiles p ON u.id = p.id
WHERE u.email = 'admin@maharaj.com';
```

Should return:
- email: admin@maharaj.com
- email_confirmed_at: (should have a date, not NULL)
- role: admin

### Option 4: Reset Password
If user exists but can't login:
```sql
UPDATE auth.users
SET 
  encrypted_password = crypt('Admin@123', gen_salt('bf')),
  email_confirmed_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'admin@maharaj.com';
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Invalid email or password"
**Solution:** Run `RESET-PASSWORD.sql`

### Issue: Still redirects to login
**Solution:** 
1. Clear browser storage
2. Check console for errors
3. Verify email is confirmed

### Issue: Infinite loading
**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase project is not paused
2. Verify API keys are correct
3. Check network tab for failed requests

## Debug Checklist
